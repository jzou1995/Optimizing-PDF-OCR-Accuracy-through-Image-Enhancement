Try and test various enhancement features of the tool, including USM sharpening, Gamma, JPG QLT, bold, auto level. Depending on the quality of the scan, you may need to adjust the features accordingly. Overdone enhancements can also hurt the quality, so you should aim for a result that is comfortable for human eyes, which will lead to high-quality OCR results.
Click "File", choose "Set DPI", then choose the folder to set all images into DPI 300.
After correctly adjusting the level of enhancement you need (step 4), click "File" then "Batch Process". Browse the folder that contains all the images, click "Process All", and agree to overwriting the pre-existing image files. This will apply all the enhancement features (step 4) onto every image.
Download "Image to pdf or xps". Import all your processed images into it to convert them into one single PDF. Choose location and name. This software will ensure that there will be no damage to image enhancement in the process of converting Image to PDF. This step is critical to ensuring good OCR results.
You now have a high-quality OCR-friendly PDF file.
